# Classification-of-Images-with-cyberbullying-actions-using-neural-networks-and-Image-Segmentation
1.Implemented VGG16 from scratch to categorize cyberbullying images into 9 categories of bullying actions. 
2.Implementation of Deeplab version 3 in TensorFlow for Image Segmentation of cyberbullying images with VGG16 network as baseline. The Loss function is a sum of classification loss for each pixel of the image and the classification loss coming from the VGG16 for classifying an image into one of the classes of cyberbullying.
